# So here is REBORN

Reborn theme for Mailspring. I liked `Less is more`, but is was just missing something. So I took all I liked about Arc-light theme, some tweaks from Isaac themes and that is how Reborn has been born. From truee love and need. :tada:

## Installing

1. [Download](https://getmailspring.com/) Mailspring - (desktop email client) if you have not yet!
2. [Just download the master branch](https://github.com/nukeknurs/Reborn/archive/master.zip):
    * Click the link right above or `Clone or Download` -> `Download ZIP` on this page.
3. Decompress the zip file.
4. Open `Mailspring` -> `Install new theme...`
5. Select the decompressed folder, usually named `Reborn`!

## Custom colors

You can change accent, background and text color to any that you like or need. 

1. Just go to `styles` -> `ui-variables.less`;

2. Open it via notepad;

3. Change any color value you want. If you have no idea what you doing just open Google, type 

    - `color you want` and add `hex`;

    - or search for hex palette;

4. For the best results I advise you to change value only in `@accent-primary:` and remember to change lighten if needed (darken work the same way). 

5. When you are done save the file and reinstall (see above for install instruction) theme via mailspring. 

    - when it's not switching restart the app or change to any other theme and then go back to `Reborn`;

6. You should be just fine, trust me! :)
